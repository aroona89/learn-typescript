/* Q#20
Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, 
rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates
a list containing these items. */

var mountainList: string[] = [ 
    "Mount Everest", 
    "K2"

// Print the mountain list
console.log("\nMountain List:");

// Array to store river names
let rivers: string[] = ["Indus", "Ganges"];
// Print the river list
console.log("\nRiver List:");
rivers.forEach(river => console.log(river));

// Array to store country names
let countries: string[] = ["Pakistan", "India"];
// Print the country list
console.log("\nCountry List:");
countries.forEach(country => console.log(country));

// Array to store city names
let cities: string[] = ["Islamabad", "Mumbai"];
// Print the city list

// Array to store language names
let languages: string[] = ["English", "Urdu"];
// Print the language list
