# Inheritence

1. the extend keyword is used to create a new class that is a subclass of an existing class. It is used to define a new class that inherits the properties and behavior of an existing class.

2. super() is a method that refers to the parent class's constructor or method. When you call super() in a child class, it calls the parent class's constructor or method with the same name.
* In the context of constructors, super() is used to call the parent class's constructor from the child class's constructor. This ensures that the parent class's initialization code is executed before the child class's initialization code.
* In the context of methods, super() is used to call the parent class's method from the child class's method. This allows the child class to reuse the parent class's implementation or build upon it.
3. Function overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a subclass 
provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
The subclass method has the same name, parameters, and return type as the superclass method, 
but it can have a different implementation. it allows you to redefine the behavior of inherited methods, 
particularly useful when a child class needs to specialize or modify the functionality provided by a parent class.
