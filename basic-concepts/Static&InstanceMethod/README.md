### Array Constructor:
- the Array constructor is a built-in function that creates new array instances.
- Object Creation: You don't use new with Array() constructor. Arrays are created directly using [] or Array().
- Unlike classes where you use new to create objects, the Array() constructor itself can be called directly to create arrays.
---
### Static Methods:
- Static methods are called directly on the Array constructor itself, not on an instance of an array.
- Examples of static methods include Array.from(), Array.isArray(), and Array.of().
---
### instance methods
- Methods like push(), pop(), or map() are called on array instances to manipulate their content.
- Array.prototype is like a reference book that defines common functionalities (methods) for all books (array instances).
