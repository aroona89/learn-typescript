Function overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a subclass 
provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 
The subclass method has the same name, parameters, and return type as the superclass method, 
but it can have a different implementation. it allows you to redefine the behavior of inherited methods, 
particularly useful when a child class needs to specialize or modify the functionality provided by a parent class.

* Inheritance: You establish a parent-child relationship between classes using the extends keyword. 
The child class inherits all the properties and methods from the parent class.
* Redefining Methods: Within the child class, you can define a method with the same name, parameters, 
and return type as a method in the parent class. This redefinition is what constitutes overriding.

Key Point: The overridden method must have the same signature (name, parameters, and return type) 
as the parent class method.
